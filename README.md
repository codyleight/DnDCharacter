# CodingCampaign

## Description

A website that allows DND Role players to create and save randomized characters for easy use in new campaigns.  

Motivation - As seasoned DND role players, we wanted to take the work out of character creation so players    
can focus more on the role play and less on min/maxing their characters.



User Story:   

- As a user building a new DND character  
    - I want to randomly generate a name for a new character
    - So I don’t have think too hard of cool character names    
- As a user building a new character  
    - I want to build out the basics for character race, class and skill  
    - So that new campaign set up moves faster and starts sooner  
- As a user building a new character  
    - I want to delegate where my base stat points   
    - This will take the guesswork of how to build a fun and strong starting character  
- As a user completing my new character  
    - I want to be able to save my new character  
    - To refer back to for old campaigns  

This project helped us learn how to incorporate new technologies with no first hand experience.

Cooperating as a unit
- Finding time to work together
- Meeting deadlines that dont just effect ourselves but the group as a whole.
- Understanding and being open to new directions the group may want to take the project.
